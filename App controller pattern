From my understanding  this is what a application controller is:

- Application controller is a centralized point for handling screen navigation and the flow of an application.
- To control UI transtition logic in a central place. 
- Centralize the flow of the application and screen navigation, so that you can change flow or logic in a single location, 
    with no changes (or minimal changes) to the source code of views.
- For complex processes we can define multiple controllers.


Strategies
    - Command Handler Strategy
    - View Handler Strategy
    - Transform Handler Strategy
    - Navigation and Flow Control Strategy
    - Message Handling Strategies
    - Custom SOAP Message Handling Strategy
    - JAX RPC Message Handling Strategy

Consequences
    - Improves modularity
    - Improves reusability
    - Improves extensibility
