Java Collections
Collection's works a bit like arrays, except their size can change dynamically, and they have more advanced behaviour than arrays.

The basic purpose of Java Collection is for the purpose of storing information. for ex. phone number, Address, name, ...

The best thing about Java Collections is grouping, changing, and updating objects.
