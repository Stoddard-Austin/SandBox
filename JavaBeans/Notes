JavaBeans
Simply is a Java class that does three things:
1. Implements the Serializable interface - To save the state of an object
  2. Exposes its properties via getter/setter methods - To get and set the values of private variables
  3. Has a no-argument constructor - To instantiate the object

Advantages include:
  - The properties, events, and methods of a bean that are exposed to another application can be controlled.
  - A bean may register to receive events from other objects and can generate events that are sent to those other objects.
  - Auxiliary software can be provided to help configure a java bean.
  - The configuration setting of bean can be saved in a persistent storage and restored.
